# Test project

The test project is a tool for measuring how you, individually, as a developer
is able to adapt to new environments and exercises.

Primary focus for this project is the working methods and how well you are able
to take in new technologies and put them to good use. Make good use of other
peoples experience by using Google for every technology problem or question you
may have.

# Required parts

## Git
You are required to use Git & Github for versioning your source code.
Put the project as a Public repository on Github and share it with me. Also,
read the Github documentation on Best practice.

## Front-end
You must create a front-end application for the application. The front-end
must be a statically loaded html, javascript and css site.

You may use libraries and languages of your own choosing.

## Back-end
You will need to write your own back-end server for handling requests from the
front-end.

You are limited to use only one of these programming languages:
* Python
* Go
* Java

# The project
Your goal is to create a web application which will work as a music player.

Back-end will keep track of the music files, and front-end will communicate with
the back-end through encrypted HTTPS. The Back-end must expose a restful API for
communication.

Font-end must buffer the audio tracks in RAM, and visually show the buffer
somehow.

Please follow the examples specified in `examples.md` to develop this software.

Suggestion: Use Bootstrap for designing the application.

# How do I start?
Please make a fork of this repository, and do your development in the fork.
And also, commit with care!

Write good commit messages which explains in short what changes are made.

It is a good practice to use Github issues and milestones!
